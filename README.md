<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Joez_Photozz_Backend] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[Joez_Photozz_Backend]** is a backend api created with Node.JS(Express) and MongoDB. The biggest challenge I faced was determining the best way to authenticate a user, prevent CSRF attacks and maintain the privacy of users data.

<!-- Challenges -->
## Challenges faced so far
<p>During my solo project developing a MERN stack photography booking application, I encountered difficulties implementing Nodemailer for email notifications. Despite thorough research and following documentation, configuring the mailing system proved challenging. To ensure users were informed of successful bookings, I pivoted to a user-friendly solution by integrating toast notifications directly into the application's interface. These notifications provided immediate feedback upon booking confirmation, enhancing the user experience without relying on external email communication.</p>

<p>Additionally, recognizing the importance of user accessibility, I expanded the user profile section to include a comprehensive list of bookings. By consolidating this feature within the user profile, users could conveniently manage their photography sessions within the application.</p>

<p>This adaptive approach, tailored to the project's solo nature, underscored my commitment to prioritizing user experience and finding innovative solutions to technical challenges. Despite working alone, I remained focused on delivering a seamless and intuitive application for users, demonstrating my ability to overcome obstacles and achieve project goals independently.</p>
